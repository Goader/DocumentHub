On 24 February 2022, Russia began a military invasion of Ukraine,[32] in a major escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict that had begun in 2014. It is the largest military conflict in Europe since World War II.[33][34][35] With over 2.9 million Ukrainians fleeing the country, the invasion has also caused the largest refugee crisis in Europe since World War II.[36][37][38]

Following the Ukrainian Revolution of Dignity in February 2014, Russia annexed Crimea, and Russian-backed separatists seized part of south-east Ukraine, starting the war in Donbas.[39][40] In 2021, Russia began a large military build-up along its border with Ukraine. The president of Russia, Vladimir Putin, espoused Russian irredentist views,[41] questioned Ukraine's right to statehood,[42][43] and accused Ukraine of being dominated by Neo-Nazis who persecute the Russian-speaking minority.[44] Putin also said NATO had threatened Russia's security by expanding eastward (a claim which NATO rejects),[45] and demanded Ukraine be barred from ever joining the alliance.[46] The United States and others accused Russia of planning to attack or invade Ukraine, which Russian officials repeatedly denied as late as 23 February 2022.[50]

On 21 February 2022, Russia recognised the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic, two self-proclaimed states in Donbas controlled by pro-Russian separatists and recognised by no other state.[51] The next day, the Federation Council of Russia authorised use of military force abroad, and Russian troops entered both territories.[52] On 24 February, at about 5:00 EET (UTC+2),[53] Putin announced a "special military operation" to "demilitarise and denazify" Ukraine.[54][55] Minutes later, missiles and airstrikes struck throughout Ukraine, including the capital Kyiv, shortly followed by a large ground invasion from multiple directions.[56][57] The president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, enacted martial law and general mobilisation.[58][59]

Multi-pronged assaults were launched from Russia proper, Belarus, and the two occupied territories of Ukraine (Crimea and Donbas). Four major war theatres developed: the Kyiv offensive, the Northeastern Ukraine offensive, the Eastern Ukraine offensive, and the Southern Ukraine offensive, while the Russian military also carried out air and missile strikes far into western Ukraine. Russian forces have approached or besieged a number of key settlements, such as Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mariupol, and Sumy,[60] but met stiff Ukrainian resistance, and experienced logistical and operational challenges that hampered their progress.[61][62] More than 3.2 million Ukrainians have fled the country in the first major humanitarian crisis in Europe since the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s.[36][37]

The invasion was widely condemned internationally. The United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution which condemned Russia's invasion and demanded a full withdrawal. Many countries imposed new sanctions which have led to economic consequences for Russia and the world economy.[63] Various countries gave humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine.[64] Protests occurred around the world; those in Russia have been met with mass arrests and increased media censorship,[65][66] including banning the terms "war" and "invasion".[57] Some companies withdrew their products and services from sale in Russia and Belarus.
